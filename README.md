Olist Sales Forecasting Project
Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast sales for Olist, a leading e-commerce platform. The primary objective is to enable data-driven decisions by predicting future sales, which helps in optimizing inventory management, refining marketing strategies, supporting financial planning, and improving supply chain efficiency.

Project Objectives
Sales Forecasting: Develop an accurate model to predict future sales based on historical data.
Inventory Optimization: Align inventory levels with forecasted demand to minimize stockouts and overstock situations.
Marketing Strategy Enhancement: Use sales forecasts to plan and execute marketing campaigns effectively.
Financial Planning: Provide reliable sales predictions for budgeting and revenue forecasting.
Supply Chain Efficiency: Streamline the supply chain by anticipating demand and reducing potential bottlenecks.
Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Historical sales data, customer information, product details, and other relevant metrics were gathered from the Olist platform.
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Performed data normalization and transformation to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Visualized insights to better understand customer behavior and product performance.
4. Statistical Analysis
Conducted statistical tests to validate key assumptions such as stationarity and seasonality.
5. Model Development
Built and compared several forecasting models, including:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
Prophet (A time series forecasting model developed by Facebook)
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
7. Deployment & Recommendations
Deployed the best-performing model.
Provided actionable insights and strategic recommendations for Olist's operations.
Results
The project successfully delivered accurate sales forecasts, leading to improved inventory management, better marketing campaign planning, more precise financial projections, and enhanced supply chain operations. These improvements contributed to overall business growth and customer satisfaction.
